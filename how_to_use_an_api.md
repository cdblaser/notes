# HOW TO USE AN API - FREECODECAMP - CRAIG DENNIS

## What is an API?

- Application Programming Interface
- Analogy: think about your remote control. It has buttons, and you know what the buttons do to make the TV work. However, you don't know how the remote control itself works. APIs are very similar - it is a tool for a developer to pull data, and the developer just needs to learn the buttons. The rest is more of a blackbox that the company providing the data deals with.

## What is REST?

- Representational State Transfer
- Essentially, it just means that the majority of data is stored on a remote server. If you're pulling data from a restful API, you need an internet connection to pull the data.

## How the web works

### What is a protocol?

- Analogy: when at a rally, somebody yells "You say foo, I say bar!" "Foo!" "Bar!". That is essentially a protocol. If you say something besides "Bar!", then you are not completing the protocol.
